# Basic-Cryptography
Encrypting and Decrypting a file using python
my first readme


1.Symmetric Key

Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext.

2.Generate a Key: Fernet.generate_key() creates a new key.

3 Save the Key: The key is saved to a file named secret.key in binary mode ('wb'). This is important because the key is binary data.
Make sure to keep the secret.key file secure and private, as anyone with access to this file can decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding key.
